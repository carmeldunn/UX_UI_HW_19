                role was to generate sketches for desktop. At the beginning of my design process, I created the low
                fidelity pencil on paper sketches which provide a way to show concepts for app functionality and
                preliminary design elements.<br /><br />I discussed with my team as we shared our sketches for mobile to
                compare. We talked out what is working and what could be better for the next stage in compiling our
                sketches for mid-fidelity. Figma was used to produce one mid and high fidelity for mobile and desktop
                for user testing. The challenge was deciding whether to keep the forms for getting or receiving a box
                and donating on a pop-up or on a one page. We knew eliminating the 19 questions survey for the user to
                go through before being asked what the user would like to do would be a good idea in order to retain the
                user on the find your anchor website to complete the tasks. To not eliminate the survey in total, we
                added it after the user submits the form and keeping it as an option.</span

                We were able to keep them on the page as they read through why you wouldn’t have to donate if the box is
                for yourself vs why you have the opportunity to donate if you’re attaining the box for someone else.<br /><br />From
                reading their behavioral reaction to the prototype for web and mobile, we saw that they were engaged
                with the homepage and became aware of what this organization is about. Though narrating their actions to
                us, the user would show a reaction of scanning through the entire page looking for an image or some
                context of what each section on a form was for before proceeding. We noticed that on the homepage, the
                chat button needed to standout more, but when found, the user liked that you could reach out to ask
                questions for a site providing resources for a health issue rather than search for the answer throughout
                the website. <br /><br />While we assumed that staying with a palette of blue and white throughout the
                website would be easy on the eyes for the user in making them feel calm, we learned that adding an
                opposite color from the color wheel would be a great addition to making the chat or hover over the
